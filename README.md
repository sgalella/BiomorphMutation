# Biomorph Mutation
Implementation of the algorithm to generate biomorphs described by Richard Dawkins in [The Evolution of Evolvability](https://richarddawkins.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Evolution-of-Evolvability.pdf). Biomorphs are created randomly over time, without selection.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Usage

Run the algorithm from the command line with:

```python
python biomorph_mutation.py
```

Biomorphs will be saved in a generated directory named `biomorphs`.
